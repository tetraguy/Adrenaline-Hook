Adrenaline Hook is a utility developed to seamlessly integrate GamePass titles into AMD Adrenalin Software. Due to Microsoft’s DRM restrictions, manually adding GamePass executables to Adrenalin is typically not possible without complex and temporary workarounds that often break after game updates.

Many GamePass games are not automatically detected by AMD Adrenalin, which prevents users from taking advantage of key AMD features like Frame Generation, Image Sharpening, and more. Adrenaline Hook eliminates this limitation.

Example:

With a simple click on “Scan MS Store/GamePass Games”, the tool will display all installed UWP apps and games. You can then select the titles you wish to hook into AMD Adrenalin.

Note: Games already added to AMD Adrenalin will be highlighted in dark red.

Once hooked, the selected game will appear in AMD Adrenalin, allowing you to configure and optimize its graphics settings.
